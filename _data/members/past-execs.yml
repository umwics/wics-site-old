    description: President<br>2019-2020
    description2: Hi! I am Tife, the new president of WICS. I am currently in my 4th year of Computer Science but in my 5th year of University. I remember being approached to be a part of the group when it was just about to become one, I felt glad and empowered to meet more women in the department and having that community changed everything for me. I hope that one day, I can help empower more women to pursue a career in STEM and recognise they are stronger than they know, and the world knows.⁣ I look forward to maintaining an environment where everyone is comfortable being in a strong community of women and men in STEM, while boldly taking bigger steps in Computer science. I look forward to working with you all this year.⁣

    description: Outreach Director<br>2019-2020
    description2: Hello everyone, I am the new WICS outreach director for the academic year as I am entering my third year of computer science. I am excited to work and collaborate with you all on outreach volunteer opportunities. WICS has been prevalent in my university experience as an encouragement to stay in the computer science field through eliminating the isolation and barriers I felt as a woman. There are so many inspiring and women in computer science and I hope to one day be one myself.⁣⁣
